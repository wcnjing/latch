# LATCH — agent core

Look-Ahead Transhipment Connection Handler. This repository is **workstream B**:
the agent core, plus the shared contracts A and C build against.

Most containers moving through Singapore are connecting between ships, often at
different terminals. When a vessel slips, those connections fail quietly — and
by the time anyone can act, the choice has already been made for them. LATCH
detects connections losing slack, resolves what it can internally, and gets the
shipping line a real choice while options still exist.

## Run it

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

## What is real and what is not

Stated here as plainly as it is stated on the slide.

| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| Vessel timing | Real, from OCEANS-X — subject to the day-1 data gate |
| Terminal assignment | Carried on every call as `TerminalResolution`: berth, terminal, inferred, or simulated |
| Connection graph | Synthetic, generated from real liner service rotations, parameters frozen before evaluation |
| ITT inventory | Synthetic — no public dataset of Singapore ITT capacity exists |
| Every write action | Stubbed. Interfaces are modelled on `COPRAR` / `IFTMBF` message semantics; the contribution is the decision layer, and the execution layer is deliberately out of scope |

`TerminalResolution` is not decoration. It travels with every vessel call and
feeds the confidence calculation, so the provenance of the inter-terminal split
is mechanical rather than rhetorical.

## Contracts

Workstream A produces `ConnectionRisk`. Workstream C renders `Trace` and
supplies the production `ConfidenceEngine`. Both live in `models.py` and
`confidence.py` — **treat changes as breaking and announce them.**

```
A ──ConnectionRisk──▶  agent core  ──Trace──▶ C
                            ▲
                            └──ConfidenceEngine── C
```

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `models.py` | Frozen contracts. Zero internal imports. |
| `state.py` | Risk lifecycle as a validated transition table |
| `trace.py` | Append-only execution trace, cost included per decision |
| `confidence.py` | Deterministic confidence from provenance |
| `locks.py` | Reservation store for contested resources |
| `tools/` | Stubbed integrations plus deterministic failure injection |

## Two design points worth knowing

**Confidence is computed, never self-reported.** The model may reason about its
certainty in a rationale; it may never write the number. The formula is
`source × age_decay × tool_outcome − unverified_penalty`, each factor taken
from the weakest input in the plan, with weights frozen in `config.py`.
`ConfidenceBreakdown.explain()` prints the derivation on one line. Combined with
the Gate Controller's policy table, this is what lets the system claim the agent
can neither self-authorise nor self-certify.

**Failures are injected from a plan, not sampled at random.** The recorded demo
has to replay identically on every take, and a scenario suite whose failures
move between runs cannot be reported as an accuracy figure. `ScriptedFailures`
drives the demo; `SeededFailures` drives the suite.

## The state diagram

Generated from the transition table so the deck cannot drift from the machine
that actually ran:

```bash
uv run python -c "from latch.state import mermaid; print(mermaid())"
```

## Cut ladder

`tests/test_locks.py::test_contention_arbitrates_on_priority_not_arrival` is a
**day-6 entry gate**. If it is not passing by end of day 6, the Lock Table is
cut and the system ships handling one risk at a time — and says so on the slide.
Cutting on day 11, after the build time is already spent, recovers nothing.
